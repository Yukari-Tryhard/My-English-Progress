**Note to self**:

2(A) _Off the top of your head_ bruh memorize it

3(A) _going_ bro. Cause associate is a verb. It's V + O(Noun) bro.

8(A) _do come_. Welp, i misunderstand the meaning i thought it was have come meaning people was coming here in the past but consider overall meaning of the phrase do come is correct

12(A) _has_. It's present perfect simple. If you see a V3 word after the blank you should have known. U sucks!

13(A) _means_. I have no clue bro, i guess i just don't understand the meaning of the phrase

23(C) _have just got on_. Because Present perfect simple is used when it describe an action in the past was happens before another action in the past

29(C) _In the direction of_ bruh memorize it

35(D) _was thinking_. I have no clue, really. I saw that line on some TV shows or movies. But ain't sure, so sometimes we gotta follow our real life knowledge.

41(E) _car journey_. I wondered between travel or journey but _car journey_ refers about the trip taken by car. and _car travel_ refers to the act of traveling by car. SO i guess journey is more suitable
