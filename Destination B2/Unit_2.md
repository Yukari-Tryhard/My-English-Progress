Total score: 68/78 --> I got scammed 1 question
```

**Note to self**:

3(A) The answer is _arrive_ because _arrive_ doesn't always have to go with _in_ or _at_ . It can go alone like "I arrived school. Where are you?"

6(C) V3 of _go_ is _gone_. Bruh how can you messed this up

4(D) _get back_ is return from a place. **from** not **to**. You ain't go anywhere. You have to use _turn (a)round_ cause we want to return home, return from where we started

6(D) V3 of _run_ is still _run_. Only the past form is different.

7(D) _can is a verb_ so you don't need to change the form of _keep up with_

2(E) _take ... route_ we do not learn about _enjoy_ in this Unit. Bruh you need to memorize this

3(F) The answer in the book is B?!!!!!!1 WHAT, it's supposed to be C. _arrange sb to do st_

5(F) _write sb_ is like write then give them what you just wrote. _write to sb_ is like write a letter to that person. So the answer is _write me_

2(G) _arrange with sb_. like uhh you can't defense yourself now. You just forgot what you learnt broaden

2(H) The question said _one word_ so it has to be _arrangements_ or else _arrangement_ must go with an _a_
